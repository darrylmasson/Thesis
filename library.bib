abstract = {The XENON100 dark matter experiment uses liquid xenon (LXe) in a time projection chamber (TPC) to search for Xe nuclear recoils resulting from the scattering of dark matter Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). In this paper we present a detailed description of the detector design and present performance results, as established during the commissioning phase and during the first science runs. The active target of XENON100 contains 62 kg of LXe, surrounded by an LXe veto of 99 kg, both instrumented with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) operating inside the liquid or in Xe gas. The LXe target and veto are contained in a low-radioactivity stainless steel vessel, embedded in a passive radiation shield. The experiment is installed underground at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS), Italy and has recently published results from a 100 live-days dark matter search. The ultimate design goal of XENON100 is to achieve a spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section sensitivity of \sigma = 2x10^-45 cm^2 for a 100 GeV/c^2 WIMP.},

@article{Miley1997,
abstract = {In the inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC) device, deuteron ions are accelerated, producing fusion reactions as they react with a deuterium plasma target. Present devices offer 106–107 2.5 MeV D-D n s−1 during steady-state operation. Higher yield pulsed versions are under development. Consequently the IEC neutron source is currently competitive, in terms of neutron strength, with Cf-252 and accelerator solid-target sources and offers a number of advantages, including an on-off capability, longer lifetime without deterioration in strength, and minimum involvement of radioactivity. These features simplify IEC usage and ease licensing restrictions. Conversion to higher energy (14 MeV) neutrons by substituting D-T fill gas for pure deuterium fill gas has confirmed the higher source strength of 108–109 D-T n s−1 for the same IEC unit size. For these reasons, the IEC provides an excellent research laboratory neutron source as well as long life, a low maintenance cost industrial source for neutron activation analysis and non-destructive testing. Two basic geometries have been developed—a spherical unit and a cylindrical unit. Spherical units have vacuum vessel diameters ranging from 15 cm to 60 cm. Present cylindrical units are approximately 12 cm in diameter and 1 m long, but smaller designs are under development. The two geometries are complementary: the spherical unit provides a ‘point’ source of neutrons, while the cylindrical device provides a ‘line’ source.},

abstract = {The LUX (Large Underground Xenon) experiment aims at the direct detection of dark matter particles via their collisions with xenon nuclei. The 370 kg two-phase liquid xenon time projection chamber measures simultaneously the scintillation and ionization from interactions in the target. The ratio of these two signals provides very good discrimination between potential nuclear recoil and electronic recoil signals to search for WIMP-nucleon scattering. The LUX detector operates at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (Lead, South Dakota, USA) since February 2013. First results were presented in late 2013 setting the world's most stringent limits on WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-sections over a wide range of WIMP masses. A 300 day run beginning in 2014 will further improve the sensitivity and new calibration techniques will reduce systematics for the WIMP signal search.},

abstract = {The occurrence in the literature of numerous, incon- sistent and limited definitions of a detection limit has led to a re-examination of the questions of signal detection and signal extraction in analytical chemistry and nuclear chemistry. Three limiting levels have been defined: Lc-the net signal level (instrument re- sponse) above which an observed signal may be reli- ably recognized as “detected”; LD-the “true” net signal level which may be a priori expected to lead to detection; and LQ-the level at which the measurement precision will be satisfactory for quantitative deter- mination. Exact defining equations as well as series of working formulae are presented both for the general analytical case and for radioactivity. The latter, assumed to be governed by the Poisson distribution, is treated in such a manner that accurate limits may be derived for both short- and long-lived radionuclides either in the presence or absence of interference. The principles are illustrated by simple examples of spectrophotometry and radioactivity, and by a more complicated example of activation analysis in which a choice must be made between alternative nuclear reactions},

In view of the GERDA Phase II data collection, four new 228-Th radioactive sources for the calibration of the germanium detectors enriched in 76-Ge have been produced with a new technique, leading to a reduced neutron flux from ( alpha; n ) reactions. The gamma activities of the sources were determined with a total uncertainty of 4 percent using an ultra-low background HPGe detector operated underground at LNGS. The emitted neutron flux was determined using a low background LiI(Eu) detector and a 3-He counter at LNGS. In both cases, a reduction of about one order of magnitude with respect to commercially available 228-Th sources was obtained. Additionally, a specific leak test with a sensitivity to leaks down to 10 mBq was developed to investigate the tightness of the stainless steel capsules housing the sources after their use in cryogenic environment.},

abstract = {Certain organic scintillators, notably anthracene, stilbene and quaterphenyl crystals and oxygen-free liquid scintillators, show an effectively longer scintillation decay time for heavily ionizing particles such as alpha-particles or protons than for electrons. A scintillation counter is described which distinguishes fast neutrons from gamma-rays by means of the different decay times of recoil proton and Compton electron scintillations respectively. Measurements of the proton-electron resolution for different scintillators are described. It is found, for example, that using a one inch thick stilbene crystal, 2 MeV neutrons may be detected with 9.5% efficiency while the detection efficiency for 2 MeV gamma-rays is reduced by decay time discrimination to less than 0.007%. An application of the counter for fission cross section measurements by fission neutron detection is described. The decay time properties of the scintillators are discussed and the longer decay time for protons (or alpha-particles) is interpreted in terms of slow (10−7 sec) ion recombination processes in the scintillators; these processes produce a slow component in the scintillation decay and in a proton scintillation the proportion of slow component is more than in an electron scintillation4).},

The applied methods and instrumentation are described and the mathematical model for diffusion of Rn, including its decay, is outlined. A very strong influence of water on the Rn diffusion through nylon foils was found. The rather low Rn permeability for dry nylon foil (mean value is equal to 3.35 × 10-12 cm2/s) increases by more than two orders of magnitude if the foil is immersed in water. No significant influence compared to dry nylon has been observed if the foil was surrounded by pseudocumene.},

abstract = {We characterize two 40 kBq sources of electrodeposited Th-228 for use in low-background experiments. The sources efficiently emanate Rn-220, a noble gas that can diffuse in a detector volume. Rn-220 and its daughter isotopes produce alpha, beta, and gamma-radiation, which may used to calibrate a variety of detector responses and features, before decaying completely in only a few days. We perform various tests to place limits on the release of other long-lived isotopes. In particular, we find an emanation of <0.008 atoms/min/kBq (90% CL) for Th-228 and 1.53 atoms/min/kBq for Ra-224. The sources lend themselves in particular to the calibration of detectors employing liquid noble elements such as argon and xenon. With the source mounted in a noble gas system, we demonstrate that filters are highly efficient in reducing the activity of these longer-lived isotopes further. We thus confirm the suitability of these sources even for use in next-generation experiments, such as XENON1T/XENONnT, LZ, and nEXO.},

abstract = {Constraints are placed on the spin-independent interaction cross section of dark matter with regular matter by refining two methods. First, dark matter--cosmic ray interactions are considered, wherein cosmic ray protons collide with dark matter to contribute to the gamma ray sky. This constraint is developed using the NFW and Moore dark matter density profiles and new data from the Fermi gamma ray space telescope. Second, the Earth capture scenario is considered, wherein particles that are captured self-annihilate at Earth's center, thus adding to its internal heat flow. The constraint presented here is developed based on analysis of the drift time of dark matter particles through Earth, modeled as a core composed of iron and a mantle composed of oxygen with linear density gradients between layers. An analysis of the cosmic ray constraint (which rules out dark matter--regular matter interaction cross sections greater than its value) shows that it overlaps significantly with the Earth drift time constraint (which rules out cross sections smaller than its value), closing the window on strongly interacting dark matter particles up to a mass of about 10^{17} GeV when combined with other exclusions.},

abstract = {Particle detectors that use liquid xenon (LXe) as detection medium are among the leading technologies in the search for dark matter weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). A key enabling element has been the low-energy detection threshold for recoiling nuclei produced by the interaction of WIMPs in LXe targets. In these detectors, the nuclear recoil energy scale is based on the LXe scintillation signal and thus requires knowledge of the relative scintillation efficiency of nuclear recoils, Leff. The uncertainty in Leff at low energies is the largest systematic uncertainty in the reported results from LXe WIMP searches at low masses. In the context of the XENON Dark Matter project, a new LXe scintillation detector has been designed and built specifically for the measurement of Leff at low energies, with an emphasis on maximizing the scintillation light detection efficiency to obtain the lowest possible energy threshold. We report new measurements of Leff at low energies performed with this detector. Our results suggest a Leff which slowly decreases with energy, from 0.144 +/- 0.009 at 15 keV down to 0.088 +0.014 -0.015 at 3 keV.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe 220Rn calibration source that was developed for liquid noble gas detectors. The key advantage of this source is that it can provide 212Bi-212Po consecutive events, which enables us to evaluate the vertex resolution of a detector at low energy by comparing low-energy events of 212Bi and corresponding higher-energy alpha-rays from 212Po. Since 220Rn is a noble gas, a hot metal getter can be used when introduced using xenon as the carrier gas. In addition, no long-life radioactive isotopes are left behind in the detector after the calibration is complete; this has clear advantage over the use of 222Rn which leaves long- life radioactivity, i.e., 210Pb. Using a small liquid xenon test chamber, we developed a system to introduce 220Rn via the xenon carrier gas; we demonstrated the successful introduction of 6 times 10^2 220Rn atoms in our test environment.},

@article{Aprile2012,
abstract = {We have measured the energy dependence of the liquid xenon (LXe) scintillation yield of electrons with energy between 2.1 and 120.2keV, using the Compton coincidence technique. A LXe scintillation detector with a very high light detection efficiency was irradiated with 137Cs {\gamma} rays and the energy of the Compton-scattered {\gamma} rays was measured with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector placed at different scattering angles. The excellent energy resolution of the HPGe detector allows the selection of events with Compton electrons of known energy in the LXe detector. We find that the scintillation yield initially increases as the electron energy decreases from 120 keV to about 60keV but then decreases by about 30% from 60keV to 2keV. The measured scintillation yield was also measured with conversion electrons from the 32.1 keV and 9.4 keV transitions of the 83mKr isomer, used as an internal calibration source. We find that the scintillation yield of the 32.1 keV transition is compatible with that obtained from the Compton coincidence measurement. On the other hand, the yield for the 9.4keV transition is much higher than that measured for a Compton electron of the same energy. We interpret the enhancement in the scintillation yield as due to the enhanced recombination rate in the presence of Xe ions left from the 32.1 keV transition, which precedes the 9.4 keV one by 220 ns, on average.},
